Rewrite entire receiver/transmitter to not use any deleay(calls). Especially with the TUSCEN code.
Rewrite the Audio FC to use Sparkfun mp3 trigger instead of existing legacy board.
Rewrite audio core to use multitracks from mp3 wav or mp3 trigger.
Refactor code.

Controller:
Controller should be a dummy. Non intelligent. It will not store information only send info and display info. 
All info displayed should be sent by the receiver.

Receiver:
Since the receiver is responsible for driving the droid, it should be the brains of it all and have all info on it.
All other are only peripherials.
Receiver should only read the controller and drive the droid, and pass through all other information.
